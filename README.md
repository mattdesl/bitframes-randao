# bitframes-randao

This repository will hold some of the scripts for a trust-minimized random raffle ceremony using Ethereum's RANDAO block attribute.

It will follow the same protocol as outlined here:

SHA-256 commitments will be posted soon to this repo, some days before the ceremony will begin, to ensure no party (not even me) can game the raffle.
