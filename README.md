# bitframes-randao

This repository will hold some of the scripts for a trust-minimized random raffle ceremony using Ethereum's RANDAO block attribute.

It will follow the same protocol as outlined here:

https://github.com/mattdesl/meridian-discord-voting

SHA-256 commitments will be posted soon to this repo, some days before the ceremony will begin, to ensure no party (not even me) can game the raffle.

## Special Conditions

Although this will use a cryptographically strong PRNG and accumulates events from the distributed ledger, some contributions will be manually omitted from the raffle, such as addresses relating to the artist and/or crowdfund organizers (mattdesl.eth, bitframes.eth, generativefilmfund.eth, etc).

## License

MIT, see [LICENSE.md](http://github.com/mattdesl/bitframes-randao/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for details.
